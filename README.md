## About The Project


A mod for the popular game DayZ, which has undergone a significant overhaul to tackle various issues. These include addressing the problem of purchased items not showing up in the inventory and fixing issues related to NULL points and unsafe down-casting. The mod, known as "Dr Jones Trader," aims to enhance the gaming experience by providing essential fixes and improvements. The last update for this mod was in February 2021, and unfortunately, it is currently considered abandonware.
