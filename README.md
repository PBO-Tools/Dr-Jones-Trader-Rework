## About The Project


A mod for the game DayZ (https://www.bohemia.net/games/dayz) has undergone a rework to address a range of issues, including problems with items not appearing in inventory after purchase and issues with NULL points and unsafe down-casting. The mod, called Dr Jones Trader (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590841260), has not been updated since February 2021 and is considered abandonware.
