## About this project
* A mod for the popular game DayZ has been extensively revamped to address several key issues. These improvements include fixing problems where purchased items were not appearing in the inventory and resolving issues related to NULL points and unsafe down-casting. Dr Jones trader mod is now being offically maintained, and as a result, this repository is now archived.
