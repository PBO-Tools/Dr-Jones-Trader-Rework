## About The Project



A mod created for DayZ (https://www.bohemia.net/games/dayz) has recently undergone significant improvements to resolve various issues. These issues encompassed items not showing up in the inventory after purchase, as well as problems with NULL points and unsafe down-casting. The mod, known as "Dr Jones Trader" (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590841260), has remained unchanged since February 2021, leading to its classification as abandonware.
